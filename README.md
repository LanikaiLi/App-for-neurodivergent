# Daily Disciplines

A warm, gentle habit tracker built with love — for neurodivergent people, highly sensitive souls, and everyone who has ever felt unseen or misunderstood.

## Why this exists

Some of us experience the world a little differently. Our brains are precision instruments — powerful, but sensitive. We feel things deeply, we notice everything, and we often forget to take care of ourselves while taking care of everyone else.

Daily Disciplines was created to change that. It's a small, cozy space where building healthy habits feels like a game, not a chore. No judgment, no shame — just gentle encouragement and the quiet satisfaction of checking things off.

**This is for you if:**

- You need routines to protect your energy, but struggle to maintain them
- You're harder on yourself than anyone else, and could use permission to celebrate small wins
- You put others first so often that you forget you matter too

## What it does

- **Today** — A daily checklist with satisfying sounds, sparkles, and confetti when you complete everything
- **Manage** — Create and customize your disciplines with point values that reflect their difficulty
- **Points** — Earn points for self-care, then spend them on real treats guilt-free
- **Analysis** — Watch your growth through streaks, completion rates, and heatmaps

Everything stays private in your browser. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking. Just you and your progress.

## Philosophy

- **Warm & cozy**, never cold or clinical
- **Simple**, never overwhelming
- **Encouraging**, never punishing

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no complexity — just a small tool doing one thing with care.
