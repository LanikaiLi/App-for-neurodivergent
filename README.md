# Daily Disciplines

A warm, gentle self-care app built with love — for neurodivergent people, highly sensitive souls, and everyone who has ever felt unseen or misunderstood.

## Why this exists

Some of us experience the world a little differently. Our brains are precision instruments — powerful, but sensitive. We feel things deeply, we notice everything, and we often forget to take care of ourselves while taking care of everyone else.

Daily Disciplines was created to change that. It's a small, cozy space where building healthy habits feels like a game, not a chore. No judgment, no shame — just gentle encouragement and the quiet satisfaction of checking things off.

**This is for you if:**

- You need routines to protect your energy, but struggle to maintain them
- You're harder on yourself than anyone else, and could use permission to celebrate small wins
- You put others first so often that you forget you matter too

##  Made with Love by Phoenix Li, for the lovely souls on this world. 
##  You are the ones who make the world better, you deserve the best love.
